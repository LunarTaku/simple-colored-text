# how to contribute
- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
- Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from develop if it exists, else from master.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- If the project has tests run them!
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's develop branch if there is one, else go for master!
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).
